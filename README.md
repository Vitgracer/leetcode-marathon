# ðŸš€ My LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
It does **not** include the original problem statements â€” only links to the problems and my code.

## Repository structure
- Solutions are grouped by programming language (e.g., `python/`, `cpp/`).
- Each file is named as: `problem_number_problem-name.extension`.
- At the top of each file, there is a link to the original problem on LeetCode.


## Example
File: `python/0001_two_sum.py`
